        Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
        Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
        Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
        Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
        Annie, are you okay? Will you tell us that you're okay?
        There's a sound at the window that he struck you, a crescendo, Annie
        He came into your apartment, and left the bloodstains on the carpet
        And then you ran into the bedroom, you were struck down, it was your doom
        Annie, are you okay? So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
        You've been hit by, you've been struck by, a smooth criminal
